# Raspberry Pi Pico pinout posters
These are files I used to print as large posters for my electronics workshop, to help students and myself make fewer mistakes with pin numbers ðŸ˜„

A4 portrait (~70cm wide)  |  A3 landscape (~90 cm)

The images are based on this diagram from Raspberry Pi:

The changes I made:
- leave out Pico's physical pin numbers (because they tend to cause confusion with beginners).
- rotate the LED label (for compactness)
- To make the portrait poster more compact:
  - leave out the debug pin labels
  - combine the ADC labels and their GP labels into one label.

Enjoy!
